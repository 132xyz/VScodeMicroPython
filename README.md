# MicroPython Workbench — MicroPython file manager for VS Code

[中文](README_zh-CN.md)

Inspired by Thonny’s simplicity, this extension streamlines MicroPython development across multiple boards. It provides remote file management, an integrated REPL, and automatic two-way synchronization, enabling a smoother workflow within VS Code.

The extension leverages **mpremote** for all board interactions, including file transfer, REPL connectivity, and command execution.

## Main features

- 📂 Remote file explorer for the device (open, download files/folders, upload, rename, delete)
- 🔄 Two-way sync: compare local files with the device and sync changed files
- 📝 Create a new file in the Files view and upload it to the board on first save
- 💽 Flash MicroPython firmware via esptool with board auto-detection (catalog driven)
- 💻 Integrated MicroPython REPL terminal
- ⏯️ Send commands to the board (stop, soft reset, etc.)
- 🧭 Files view shows the detected board name and status bar displays last auto-sync time
- 🧠 **IntelliSense code completion** for MicroPython modules with auto-detection and multi-language support

## Quick Start

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace or build and install the `.vsix`:

```bash
# build package (requires vsce)
npm ci
npm run compile
npm run package
# then install the generated .vsix in VS Code (Extensions > ... > Install from VSIX)
```

2. Ensure dependencies are available on your machine:

```bash
# Python 3.8+ (recommended >=3.10)
# `mpremote` is bundled with the extension — no external installation required.
# If you plan to flash firmware, install `esptool` into the Python environment you
# want the extension to use:
python -m pip install --user esptool
```

 ```bash
 # Python 3.8+ (recommended >=3.10)
 # `mpremote` is required by this extension. Install it into the Python environment
 # you want the extension to use, for example:
 #
 # python -m pip install --user mpremote
 # ```

## Configuration

Key settings (see extension settings in VS Code):

- `microPythonWorkBench.syncLocalRoot`: local folder to sync (default: `""` meaning workspace root).
- `microPythonWorkBench.autoSyncOnSave`: enable auto-sync on save (default: `false`).
- `microPythonWorkBench.pythonPath`: Python executable to use when invoking `esptool`/helpers.

For full list of configuration options see `package.json` -> `contributes.configuration`.

## Current limitations and notes

- Firmware catalog and board testing currently focused on ESP32 variants (ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3). Expand catalog entries before relying on automatic detection for other boards.
- The project includes a CI workflow that runs build/tests across multiple OS and Node.js versions; however unit test coverage is limited—please run `npm test` locally and extend tests for core modules (`sync`, `board`, `completion`).

## Sync utilities

These commands perform full or incremental synchronization between your local workspace and the connected MicroPython board:

- **Check for differences:** Lists new, changed, or deleted files between local and board.
- **Sync Local → Board:** Uploads only local files that are new or modified.
- **Sync Board → Local:** Downloads only board files that are new or modified.
- **Upload all Local → Board:** Uploads all non-ignored local files to the device.
- **Download all Board → Local:** Downloads all board files, overwriting local copies.
- **Delete all files on board:** Removes all files on the device.

## Useful commands (Command Palette)

- `MPY Workbench: Refresh` — refresh the file tree
- `MPY Workbench: Check files differences` — show diffs and local-only files
- `MPY Workbench: Sync changed Files (Local → Board)` — upload changed local files
- `MPY Workbench: Sync changed Files (Board → Local)` — download changed board files
- `MPY Workbench: Sync all files` — full upload or download
- `MPY Workbench: Upload Active File` — upload the current editor file
- `MPY Workbench: Select Serial Port` — pick device port
- `MPY Workbench: Open REPL Terminal` — open MicroPython REPL
- `MPY Workbench: Flash MicroPython Firmware` — flash firmware using the bundled catalog and esptool
- `MPY Workbench: Toggle workspace Auto-Sync on Save` — enable/disable workspace auto-sync
- `MPY Workbench: Toggle Code Completion` — enable/disable MicroPython code completion

## Workspace config

The extension stores per-workspace settings and manifests inside a workspace folder named `.mpy-workbench` at your project root.

- Workspace override file: `.mpy-workbench/config.json`
- Sync manifest: `.mpy-workbench/esp32sync.json`

Use the command `MicroPython WorkBench: Toggle workspace Auto-Sync on Save` to enable or disable auto-sync for the current workspace. If no workspace config exists the extension falls back to the global setting `microPythonWorkBench.autoSyncOnSave` (default: `false`).

### Local sync root directory

By default, sync operations use the workspace root directory. You can configure a different local root directory using the `microPythonWorkBench.syncLocalRoot` setting:

- **Empty (default)**: Uses the workspace root directory
- **Relative path**: e.g., `"mpy"`, `"src"` or `"micropython"` — interpreted relative to workspace root
- **Absolute path**: Full path to a directory outside the workspace

For many users the practical workflow is to set a single project subfolder (for example `mpy`) as the local sync root. When mapping device paths to local files the extension now always maps device paths into the configured local sync root. Concretely:

- If your `microPythonWorkBench.syncLocalRoot` is `mpy` and a device file is `/mpy/t.py`, it maps to `./mpy/mpy/t.py` (device path components are preserved under the local sync root).
- If the device root is a workspace-scoped generated name (used when `microPythonWorkBench.rootPath` is `/`), that device root itself maps to the local sync root (empty relative path), and child paths map to their relative paths beneath it.

This behavior ensures device files are always placed under the configured sync directory. See `example-workspace-settings.json` for a complete configuration example.

## Code Completion

The extension provides intelligent code completion for MicroPython modules using Python stub files. This feature integrates with VS Code's Pylance language server to provide IntelliSense support.

### Auto-detection

Code completion automatically enables when:
- A MicroPython project is detected (based on sync settings or project structure)
- The workspace contains MicroPython-specific files or configurations
- Manual override via command or settings

### Multi-language Support

- **English**: Default documentation language
- **Chinese**: Automatically used when VS Code language is set to Chinese
- Supports 47+ MicroPython modules with type annotations

### Configuration Options

```json
{
  "microPythonWorkBench.enableCodeCompletion": "auto",
  "microPythonWorkBench.enableMultiLanguageDocs": true
}
```

- `microPythonWorkBench.enableCodeCompletion`:
  - `"auto"` (default): Automatically enable for MicroPython projects
  - `"manual"`: Manual control via commands
  - `"forced"`: Always enabled regardless of project type
  - `"disabled"`: Completely disabled

- `microPythonWorkBench.enableMultiLanguageDocs`: Enable multi-language documentation based on VS Code locale

### Manual Control

Use `MPY Workbench: Toggle Code Completion` from the Command Palette to manually enable/disable code completion for the current workspace.

### Requirements

- **Pylance extension** (recommended): `ms-python.vscode-pylance` for full IntelliSense support
- Code completion works with any Python language server but provides enhanced experience with Pylance

### Auto-suspend and REPL restore

- `microPythonWorkBench.serialAutoSuspend` (default: `true`): closes REPL/Run terminals before file ops to avoid port conflicts, then restores what was open afterward (re-runs Run Active File, or reopens REPL).
- `microPythonWorkBench.replRestoreBehavior` (default: `none`): what to do when REPL is restored after auto-suspend/auto-sync:
  - `runChanged`: Auto run the changed/saved file in REPL after sync.
  - `executeBootMain`: send Ctrl-D so boards that auto-run `main.py`/`boot.py` after reset will restart.
  - `openReplEmpty`: reopen the REPL without sending anything.
  - `none`: do not reopen the REPL.

## Status indicators

- Status bar shows `MPY: AutoSync ON/OFF`, a cancel-all-tasks button, and `MPY: LastSync <time>` after each auto-sync run.
- Files view header displays the detected board name/ID once a fixed serial port is selected.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** - The extension uses Python to run the bundled mpremote tool
- **mpremote** - ✅ **Bundled with extension** (no external installation needed)
- **Firmware flashing:** `esptool` available in the same Python environment. Install with `pip install esptool`. The extension checks `python`, `py -3` (Windows), and `esptool.py`/`esptool` on PATH.
- **Code Completion (optional):** [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) extension for enhanced IntelliSense support
- The Python path used by the extension can be adjusted in the extension settings if a specific interpreter needs to be selected.

## Firmware flashing

- Choose a specific serial port (not `auto`), then run `MicroPython WorkBench: Flash MicroPython Firmware` from the Command Palette or Board Actions view.
- The extension detects the board, picks the matching entry from `assets/firmwareCatalog.json`, downloads the image, and runs `esptool` at 460800 baud.
- Put the board in bootloader mode first; the REPL is automatically closed during flashing to free the port.
- Add more boards by appending entries to `assets/firmwareCatalog.json` (chip, flash mode/freq, offset, download URL, and aliases).

## Next steps

- ✅ Broaden board compatibility (currently tested only with ESP32-S3 and ESP32-C3)
- 🔌 Expand the firmware catalog beyond the initial ESP32-C6 entry
- 🪟 Perform full Windows testing: validate mpremote compatibility with COM ports and ensure consistent behavior of file operations and REPL across Windows environments
